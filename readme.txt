What is Wiremo?

Wiremo is a customer review platform for WordPress websites and other platforms. Powered by AI, Wiremo collects and showcases customer reviews alongside gorgeous photos in a dynamic, front-page-worthy reviews carousel.
Compatible with WordPress, Squarespace and Shopify, Wiremo boosts social proof, sales and SEO through the power of user-generated content (UGC). Wiremo uses AI to analyze review sentiment and only display positive reviews that build your brand.

The platform is easy to set up and use for both eCommerce store owners and customers. Wiremo’s auto-reply feature starts support conversations with users in more than 15 languages and asks follow-up questions directly on your landing page. 
To encourage engagement, Wiremo can automatically ask for customer feedback via email and display the new reviews on your website.
